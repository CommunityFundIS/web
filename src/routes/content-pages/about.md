# Purpose of Community Fund #

The Community Fund empowers the grassroots of the tech community in Iceland by easing their access to funds and support. It is created for smaller projects like meetups, workshops, knowledge sharing and conference preparation, that are likely to enrich the tech community.

The fund started in May 2017.

We will evaluate the effect and outcomes of the fund in a year's time, and decide whether to raise another edition.
