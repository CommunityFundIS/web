The Community Fund aims to answer all requests within 5 working days.

The Community Fund mainly supports open initiatives and events (i.e. that are open to all).
- The exception to this are initiatives that may require participants to purchase tickets, such as talks with expensive speakers or preparation of conferences.

The Community Fund aims to support projects that require small amounts of money to have an intended impact. We want the fundâ€™s support  to have an impact.
- This means that the fund might not support bigger events where a smaller grant contribution will not impact the viability of the event in a meaningful way.

# About the fund

The Community Fund empowers the grassroots of the tech community in Iceland by easing their access to funds and support. It is created for smaller projects like meetups, workshops, knowledge sharing and conference preparation, that are likely to enrich the tech community.

The fund started in May 2017.

We will evaluate the effect and outcomes of the fund in a year's time, and decide whether to raise another edition.
