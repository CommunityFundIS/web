# Grant review guidelines #

The following are the guidelines the grant review boards follows to support their decision making.

The Community Fund supports initiatives that focus on skill-sets that are essential to the tech community. These include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Computer engineering / development and operations
- User interface design
- User experience design
- Data analysis, warehousing, and development
- Software testing
- Product management
- Tech-focused project management

The Community Fund aims to answer all requests within 5 working days.

The Community Fund mainly supports open initiatives and events (i.e. that are open to all).
- The exception to this are initiatives that may require participants to purchase tickets, such as talks with expensive speakers or preparation of conferences.

The Community Fund aims to support projects that require small amounts of money to have an intended impact. We want the fundâ€™s support  to have an impact.
- This means that the fund might not support bigger events where a smaller grant contribution will not impact the viability of the event in a meaningful way.
